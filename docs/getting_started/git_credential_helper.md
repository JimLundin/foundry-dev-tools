# Git credential helper

The git credential helper can pass the credentials from your Foundry DevTools configuration to git.
This way you can clone and work with repositories without specifying the token in the URL, and the need to replace the token in the .git/config file in your repository after it expired.

For more information on how to set it up see: [Git Credential Helper](#foundry_dev_tools.cli.git_credential_foundry)
